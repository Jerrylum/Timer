### Brief

JerryTimer is a simple countdown timer and stopwatch. It has everything you need.<br>

In order to change the hour, minute, second, or millisecond, you can press one of these numbers and type a new value. Also, you can hide the timer's button if you want to. It is very useful for examinations, quizzes, and everything that requires a timer. The black background makes it more comfortable to display using a projector. Of course, you can change the theme settings as you like.
